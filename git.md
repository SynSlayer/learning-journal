# Learning Git

## What is git?
 Git gives me the freedom to edit remote repositories, this allows me to modify repositories that I have stored in GitHub from a terminal that has Git installed

### Example of how it's used;
* If you want to add a file:
```git
git add file.txt
```
* If you want to add multiple files:
```git
git add file1.txt file2.txt file2.txt
```
* To commit a file
```git
git commit -m "file committed"
```
* To push the file
```git
git push origin master
```
